# Session Progress Report

This document summarizes the development progress made during this session.

## 1. Enhanced Inter-Page Navigation

To create a more cohesive experience between the main strategic plan and the infographic, the following navigation links were added:

- **CTA on `index.html`**: A visually appealing "Call to Action" section was added to the main page, inviting users to view the data-centric infographic.
- **Backlink on `infographic.html`**: A clear "‚Üê Back to Full Strategic Plan" link was added to the top of the infographic page, ensuring users can easily return to the main document.

## 2. Floating Audio Player Implementation & Debugging

A persistent, floating audio player was implemented to provide an audio overview for users as they browse the site.

### Key Features:

- **Cross-Page Persistence**: The player uses `localStorage` to save its state (current playback time, play/pause status, and visibility). When a user navigates between `index.html` and `infographic.html`, the audio seamlessly resumes from where it left off.
- **Smart Default Visibility**: To increase prominence without being intrusive, the player is **expanded by default on a user's first visit**. If the user closes the player, this preference is saved, and the player will start in its collapsed (icon) state on all subsequent page loads.

### Troubleshooting & Iteration:

The implementation involved a multi-step debugging process to resolve asset hosting issues:

1. **Initial Attempt (Google Drive `.wav`)**: Failed due to Google's virus-scan modal on large files, which blocked direct embedding.
2. **Second Attempt (Google Drive `.mp3`)**: Failed due to a `403 Forbidden` error caused by Google Drive's restrictive CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy.
3. **Final Solution (Dropbox `.mp3`)**: The audio file was moved to Dropbox, and the sharing URL was modified (`dl=1`) to create a direct-stream link. This successfully resolved the hosting and CORS issues.
